# ExploreEuropeLanding

This is the repo of [Explore Europe's Website](https://www.exploreeurope.de/)!
It's built with pure HTML and styled with tailwindCSS.

### Structure

- **index.html** (homepage)
- **eudentity.html** (signup page)
- **imprint.html** (imprint & privacy data)
- **assets** (directory with all relevant media)
  - **icons** (icons in png or svg format)
  - **illustrations** (svg illustrations from [undraw.co](https://undraw.co/))
  - **img** (photos of our product)

### Documentation

Our git history is pretty well written and I think it shouldn't be too hard to understand the project since it's basically just HTML with some css classes.

If you want to learn more about the styles used across our page, head over to [tailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/)!
