# Workflow for Git & GitHub

This repo is publically available for everyone, so contribution requires no distinct access.
However, it's possible to get whitelisted as a collabortor. This will allow you to push directly to master or merge pull request on you own. Please only do so, if you're certain of the changes and consequences.

## Requirements

- Locally installed version of git
- Github Account
- Code Editor
- Basic git & navigation skills in the terminal

## General flow

- Contribute like explained here: [GitHub Contribution Guide](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)
- Afterwards you have to wait for a collaborator to merge your PR
