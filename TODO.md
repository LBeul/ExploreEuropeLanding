# Open Tasks:

### Picture

We need a picture of our product on the landing page (/index.html). Ideally, it should be resonsive and clean.

### Logo

We have to implement the company's logo into the circular div on /index.html. Minor adjustments in Figma or similar may be required.

### Burger & Dropdown

Right now, our site doesn't really need a dropdown menu, as it's really small and just a landing page to sell a product. However, it may be expanded in a while, so it's good to already have the dropdown menu ready to roll.

### Imprint Styling

Right now, imprint.html is ugly. It doesn't need to be the prettiest thing ever, since it's just a legal requirement, but why don't make it look at leat somewhat appealing?
